 * * [API documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuring-privileged-credentials-using-api)
 *
 * The **zpa_pra_credential_controller** resource creates a privileged remote access credential in the Zscaler Private Access cloud. This resource can then be referenced in an privileged access policy resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as zpa from "@bdzscaler/pulumi-zpa";
 *
 * //## PASSWORDS OR RELATED CREDENTIALS ATTRIBUTES IN THIS FILE ARE FOR EXAMPLE ONLY AND NOT USED IN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ####
 * // Creates Credential of Type "USERNAME_PASSWORD"
 * const _this = new zpa.PRACredential("this", {
 *     name: "John Doe",
 *     description: "Created with Terraform",
 *     credentialType: "USERNAME_PASSWORD",
 *     userDomain: "acme.com",
 *     username: "jdoe",
 *     password: "",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as zpa from "@bdzscaler/pulumi-zpa";
 *
 * //## PASSWORDS OR RELATED CREDENTIALS ATTRIBUTES IN THIS FILE ARE FOR EXAMPLE ONLY AND NOT USED IN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ####
 * // Creates Credential of Type "SSH_KEY"
 * const _this = new zpa.PRACredential("this", {
 *     name: "John Doe",
 *     description: "Created with Terraform",
 *     credentialType: "SSH_KEY",
 *     userDomain: "acme.com",
 *     username: "jdoe",
 *     privateKey: `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
 * MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQDEjc8pPoobS0l6
 * -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
 * `,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Zscaler offers a dedicated tool called Zscaler-Terraformer to allow the automated import of ZPA configurations into Terraform-compliant HashiCorp Configuration Language.
 *
 * Visit
 *
 * **pra_credential_controller** can be imported by using `<CREDENTIAL ID>` or `<CREDENTIAL NAME>` as the import ID.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import zpa:index/pRACredential:PRACredential this <credential_id>
 * ```
 *
 * or
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import zpa:index/pRACredential:PRACredential this <credential_name>
 * ```
